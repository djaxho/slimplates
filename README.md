# Slimplates

This repo can be used rapidly launch a simple site using the [Slim Framework](http://www.slimframework.com/) with the [Plates](http://platesphp.com/) template engine. It also uses a cool library called [slim-view-plates](https://github.com/media32/slim-view-plates) to support the Plates template engine with Slim. I've included [Foundation 5](http://foundation.zurb.com/), jquery, and a CDN served version of [Font Awesome](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/icons/). This layout is just a basic Foundation 5 layout. This repo was created so I could suss out the qualities of using Slim and Plates.
